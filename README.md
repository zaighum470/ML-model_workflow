Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values using SimpleImputer.

Scaled numerical features with StandardScaler.

Encoded categorical data with OneHotEncoder.

Pipeline & ColumnTransformer

Combined preprocessing steps into a clean, reproducible ML pipeline.

Model Training

Applied Logistic Regression for binary classification.

Evaluation

Assessed model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

⚙️ Tools & Libraries

Python

NumPy, Pandas for data handling

Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

Scikit-learn for preprocessing, pipeline, and modeling

📈 Outcome
